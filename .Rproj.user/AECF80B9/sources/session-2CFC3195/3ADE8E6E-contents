<br>  

#### 1. Onboarding  

```{r, out.width = "100%", out.height = "150%", echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("SSRP_2022.pdf"))

```  


`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **Complete the below 4 courses and send the certificate of completion to both [Wendy](mailto:wrobinson@bcchr.ca), [Maria](mpenaherrera@bcchr.ca), and [Nikita](mailto:nikita.telkar@bcchr.ca).**    


[Sign-up for a LearningHub account](https://accounts.learninghub.phsa.ca/Account/Register), if you do't already have on - select the health organization affiliation as Provincal Health Services Authority, and the agency as Children’s and Women’s Health Centre.

- (Infection Prevention and Control Practices for Health Care Personnel Not Invovled in Direct Clinical Care)[https://learninghub.phsa.ca/Courses/8301/infection-prevention-and-control-practices-for-health-care-personnel-not-involved-in-direct-clinical-care]
- (Privacy and Security 101)[https://learninghub.phsa.ca/Courses/3544/privacy-and-security-101]  
- (Provincial Code Red — Fire Safety)[https://learninghub.phsa.ca/Courses/10853/provincial-code-red-fire-safety-training-acute-long-term-care-facilities]  
- (Respectful Workplace — Fostering a Culture of Respect (CW Course))[https://learninghub.phsa.ca/Courses/3811/respectful-workplace-fostering-a-culture-of-respect]   


Once submitted to Wendy, she will:  

- Review the course certificates for completion  
- Arranging a BC Ministry of Justice Criminal Record Check  
- Submit a BCCHR Onboarding request  

Once an Onboarding request has been submitted and approved, your BCCHR directory profile and network account/email will be created. The temporary password will be sent to Wendy.  

<br>

`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **Get your security ID photo (Instructions on when and where to report will be emailed to Wendy).**   

`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **Send me an email from your new BCCHR email address! `r emo::ji("partying_face")`**   

***  

#### 2.0 Literature   

`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **Read the following papers, and make a `.Rmd` report answering the questions below**:

1. [Paper that you will be comparing Robinson Lab data with](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15476286.2021.1963105)  
2. [My mini-review on small non-coding RNAs and their functions in the placenta](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.868598/full)  
3. [Paper describing the role of microRNAs in the placenta](https://linkinghub-elsevier-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/retrieve/pii/S0002-9378(15)00534-7)  

*Don't hesitate to ask me questions while reading! For example, if you don't understand something, or want to know more.*  

<br>

I don't expect the answers to the below questions to be long, just enough to demonstrate that you understand the functioning of the major biological components of your project.  

Q1. What is the main function of the placenta?  

Q2. Why is studying the placenta important?  

Q3. What are microRNAs?  

Q4. What do we know about microRNAs in the placenta and their contribution to disease?  

Q5. Write a short summary of what the Smith, M.D. et al. paper (Paper 1) discovered.  

Q6. What were some questions you thought might be interesting to find answers to (which haven;t been discussed or researched already), from reading the above papers?

#### 3.0 Stats Videos and R Tutorial

Watch the 5 `Introduction to Statistics` videos and work through the [hands-on R tutorial](https://bcchr.ca/summerprogram/statistical-videos) I made for the BCCHR Summer Student Program last year.  

`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **How easy or difficult did you find the tutorial?**  
`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **Do also sign up for the SSRP `Intro to R` Workshop scheduled for June 14 2022**  

***  

#### 4.0 Make a GitHub Account  

Sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is where you'll upload all your project code and documents online. Read about what Git and GitHub is [here](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/).  

`r emo::ji("space_invader")` See if you can follow this [Intro to Git and GitHub tutorial](https://github.com/BCCHR-trainee-omics-group/StudyGroup/blob/master/workshops/2021-16-02_intro_to_github/TOG_git_tutorial.md) made by the [BCCHR Trainee 'Omics Group (TOG)](https://bcchr.ca/tog) and link your RStudio to your GitHub profile! You can check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/nikita-telkar) to get an idea of how it looks!  

`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **Let me know your GitHub account, so that I can add you to your project repository**  

***  

#### 5.0 Weekly Log  

`r emo::ji("four_leaf_clover")` **Keep a log of everything that you do - no matter how big or small.**    

We'll discuss it at every weekly meeting that we'll have. This is to give you practice of keeping a record of your work, because even though you might say sometime in the future that "I don't need to write this down, I'll remember!", you definitely will forget (happens to all researchers!)    


***  

#### `r emo::ji("space_invader")`      

Work through this `Introduction to data wrangling in R` workshop hosted by TOG.  

[Workshop folder](https://github.com/BCCHR-trainee-omics-group/StudyGroup/tree/master/workshops/2021-12-16_data_wrangling_ak) | [Workshop Recording](https://bcchr.ca/tog/tog-events/workshop-recordings)
